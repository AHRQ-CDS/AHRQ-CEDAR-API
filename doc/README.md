# CEDAR API Documentation

CEDAR documentation such as the introduction and getting started guide are now maintained in a
separate location dedicated to static CEDAR content: the cedar_documentation directory within a
private cedar_deployment repository. This directory is eventually expected to move to a separate
standalone repository.
