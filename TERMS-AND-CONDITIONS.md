CEDAR Terms and Conditions
==========================

I. Introduction
---------------

CEDAR is a web service that facilitates access to and findability of
evidence resources within specific evidence repositories. Anticipated
users of CEDAR include, but are not limited to, software developers who
create applications that interact with the CEDAR API and end users
(e.g., clinicians, researchers, and patients) of evidence artifacts that
are stored in repositories indexed by CEDAR and who may access CEDAR via
different mechanisms such as an application that uses the CEDAR API.

II. Purpose
-----------

These terms and conditions govern the relationship between the Users and
Operators of CEDAR. By using CEDAR, the User agrees to comply with and
be subject to these terms and conditions.

IV. Use of CEDAR
----------------

Use of CEDAR is conditional on adherence to these Terms & Conditions.
Users must also comply with CEDAR's Code of Conduct and Contribution
Process.

There is no fee or cost to use CEDAR.

V. Ownership
------------

### Copyright

AHRQ has copyrighted CEDAR and licenses it under Apache 2.0. Artifacts
indexed by CEDAR retain their original copyright, ownership and license.
Contributor submissions retain their original copyright and ownership
but grant CEDAR Operators a Copyright and Patent License as per the
Apache 2 license.

### Derivative Works

Anyone may substantially extend CEDAR so as to constitute a "derivative
work" within the meaning of 17 USC 101. The GO encourages all derivative
works' widespread distribution, use, and experimentation. All derivative
works must comply with the terms of the Apache license.

### Modification of Terms and Conditions

These Terms and Conditions may change over time. The Governing
Organization will notify Users of any change in the Terms and Conditions
via a post on the CEDAR web site a minimum of 30 days prior to the
effective date of the change. Users may decline to accept the revised
terms and conditions by discontinuing use of CEDAR. Continued use of
CEDAR shall constitute acceptance of the modified Terms and Conditions.

VI. Warranties
--------------

### No CEDAR Warranty

The GO provides CEDAR "as is." It excludes all warranties, either
express or implied.

### No Artifact Warranty

The GO makes no warranties about any Artifacts indexed by CEDAR or the
content of the websites to which Artifacts retrieved by CEDAR link.
Users are responsible for verifying that Artifacts indexed by CEDAR are
fit for purpose.

### No Completeness Warranty

The GO makes no warranties about the completeness of results provided by
CEDAR for any given combination of search criteria. Additional non-CEDAR
searches may uncover additional PCOR artifacts not identified by CEDAR.

VII. Privacy
------------

The CEDAR web service logs all requests including any supplied search
parameter values. Logs may be accessed and analyzed by Operators to
assess the performance of CEDAR and plan future work. Care should be
taken by Users not to include confidential or personal information in
requests to CEDAR.

CEDAR also logs the IP address of client applications, but CEDAR
Operators are not able to link requests to individuals.

VIII. Limitation of Liability
-----------------------------

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Operator be liable to any User for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions or out of
the use or inability to use CEDAR (including but not limited to damages
for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Operator
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

IX. Prohibited Conduct
----------------------

The CEDAR web service is a shared resource. Users are prohibited from:

1.  Attempting to gain unauthorized access to internal CEDAR systems

2.  Overloading CEDAR with too many requests

3.  Incorporating CEDAR in applications that:

    -   Violate any law or government regulation, or promotes or
        facilitates such action by third parties

    -   Is fraudulent, deceptive, unfair or predatory

    -   Causes or threatens to damage and Operator's reputation

Violating these Terms and Conditions may result in penalties up to and
including blocking of Users from use of CEDAR.
